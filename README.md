# Description
This was made during the second year of my studies. One of the things we had to make was an Ambient Specular Diffuse lighting. 
This was done in a fragment shader and supports multiple lights. For another assignment during this course, we had to make a quad using opengl and then make an adjustable checkerboard pattern on it.
For the last assignment, we had to make a terrain from a plane a height map and a splat map. after this we had to recalculate the normals.
